# Census
- The project uses a Spring Boot api with a MySql database.
- The frontend is an Angular CLI project with bootstrap for styling.

The spring docker container is unfortunately incomplete, but the solutions can run locally.

# Running the angular app
The Angular app uses the Angular CLI project, so after installing npm you can run these commands:

```sh
$ npm install
$ ngServe
```

The app will be on port localhost:4200

#Running the spring app

You can run the app using intelliJ, it has been configured to use Spring boot so it should run in a computer with a Tomcat server
